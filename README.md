# CAPACITOR_METER_MEASUREMENT
Capacitance Measurement with STM-32 using ADC and Timer Modules

This repository presents a digital capacitance meter project utilizing an STM-32 microcontroller with integrated Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) and Timer modules. The primary objective of this project is to accurately measure the capacitance of a capacitor within the effective range of 1nF to 100uF. The achieved resolution spans from 0.5nF to a few hundred nanofarads at the higher end of the capacitance range. The results were observed on the proteus simulation
